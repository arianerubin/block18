Expect multiplication(-2, 3) to be equal to -6.
Expect multiplication(0, 3) to be equal to 0.
Expect multiplication(a, 3) to be an error.
Expect multiplication(undefined, 3) to be an error.


2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
Should return a single array of odd numbers in ascending order.
Should include odd numbers
Should not include even numbers
When multiples of the same odd number in the array should just show once

Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an array.
Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be equal to [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15].
Expect concatOdds([2, 4, 6], [1, 2, 3]) to be equal to [1, 3].
Expect concatOdds([1, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3]) to be equal to [1, 3].
